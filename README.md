This dataset is from the <a href = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">UCI Machine Learning Repository</a>, courtesy of: 
1. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
2. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
3. University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
4. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation: Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D. 

I pulled the dataset from  <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset">Kaggle.com</a>.

This dataset measures the presence of heart disease in 303 patients and was donated in 1988. The original study had 76 attributes, but this experiment will use a subset of 14. It also focuses on the data from the Cleveland Clinic. 

This was my first machine learning project! My work was in python with sklearn. I used Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models to predict a patient's heart disease status based on various attributes such as age, resting heart rate, chest pain, etc. I plan on looking into this data further. From my visualizations, the data seems to be be backwards when it comes to assessing heart disease, such as suggesting that patients with low cholesterol and normal blood flow are more at risk for heart disease. I will be validating my results with the UCI database soon.

This project taught me new visualization techniques, feature scaling, model analysis, and classification techniques.
